<h1>fearless-design</h1>
<p>A place for sharing design resources and source files. Please read the information below before you begin navigating the repo.</p>

<h2>Before You Begin!</h2>
<p>Most if not all of the templates within this repo contain our branding. In order to maintain that branding on your desktop, please download our company typefaces <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat+Alternates">Monsterrat Alternatives</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat">Monsterrat</a> here. Or, you can just open them in Google docs! </p>

<h2>Can't find what you need?</h2>
<p>Some of the design resources come in form of links! If you aren't finding what you need in the source files, check the "links" file within each folder. If you still can't find what you need, or you have something to contribute, please contact vpeters-rodbell@fearless.tech so that they can place it into the repo (assuming it exists).
